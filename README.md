[![](https://vueschool.io/media/13867ba07d6eacdf868c78a340784a52/scoped-slots-course-not-transparent.jpg)](https://vueschool.io/courses/reusable-vuejs-components-with-slots)

This repository contains the example code for the [Reusable Vue.js Components with Slots](https://vueschool.io/courses/reusable-vuejs-components-with-slots) course.

In this course, you'll learn how to use slots and scoped slots to create flexible and reusable Vue.js components.

Slots allow us to pass components and HTML to components, giving us greater control of the appearance than what we get with props.

Slots do not replace props. The two features have different purposes.

**During the course, you'll learn:**

- When and how to use slots
- What scoped slots are
- How to work with dynamic named components
- How to compose components with reusable component patterns
